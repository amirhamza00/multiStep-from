This is a multi step From design using react js. I have use the vite to create this project. Vite is much faster the npx package. 
for styling i used the tailwind css .  it is a 3 step sign up form, without filling up each field user cant go to next step. In third step user can add image and user can crop the image as per user need after filling up all field user can request for submit.
